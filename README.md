## ðŸ§© Overview
This project reads a list of employees from a text file, stores them dynamically in an array of structs, and determines which employee has the **highest salary**.  
It demonstrates core C programming skills such as:

- File input and output operations  
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc()`  
- Struct-based data management  
- Function modularization and header file usage

## ðŸ§± File Structure
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `main.c` | Program entry point. Reads data, finds best employee, writes output, frees memory. |
| `employee.c` | Contains implementations for reading data, finding top salary, and writing results. |
| `employee.h` | Defines the `Employee` struct and function prototypes. |
